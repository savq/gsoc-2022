<!-- I was sick during this week, so I did very little work. -->

## DONE

- Write minimal "messaging protocol" for communication between server and worker.
  It should have different types of messages including:
  - `eval` request
  - `completion` request
  - `exit` request
  The `eval` request should serialize messages appropriately.
